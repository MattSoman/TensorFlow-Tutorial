    "CNN example using a Keras model. This is a simple example of a 2-conv layer with max pooling CNN example that has fully connected (Dense) layers following prior to the output prediction. This example is used for processing the MNIST (or CFAR10) data using the Adam optimiser. \n",

This constitutes a 3072 dimensional input feature space (32x32x3), where each feature is an 8bit colour representation, i.e. a number between 0 and 255.

    "\n",
    "In order for an image to be processed efficiently by a neural network the pixel colour in the range $[0, 255]$ is mapped into the domain $[0, 1]$, following the usual [Efficient Backpropagation](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf) data wrangling guidelines. For an MLP the 28x28 pixel image features (i.e. the pixels) are considered a linear set of 784 features that are input to the network.\n",

    "----------------------\n",
    "## Load and pre-process the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST data are directly accessible via keras as a dataset. So we first load the data. As noted above (and as you will have explored in the linear regression example), it is important to closely match the weights used in a network with the feature space domain that is being studied, so that the optimiser has less work to do in order to converge to the optimal solution.  In this case we achieve that by mapping the 8-bit greyscale color value $[0, 255]$ on the domain $[0, 1]$."
