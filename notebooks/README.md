Overview:
----------------------------

This file provides a brief overview of the contets of this directory

LinearRegression.ipynb
  This is a simple linear regression example
  
NN.ipynb
  This is a multilayer perceptron example for use with the MNIST data
  
NN_parabola.ipynb
  This is a multilayer perceptron example with the parabolic data
  
CNN.ipynb
  This is a convolutional neural network for use with the MNIST and CFAR10
  data.
  
HyperParameter Scan Scripts:
----------------------------
  This tutorial also comes with a number of scripts.  Please see the scripts directory
  for those examples. These have not been convered into notebooks as they can take a
  long time to run.

SciKit Learn Examples

These have been included to provide access to examples of other types of supervised learning algorithms that may be encountered in the physcial sciences, beyond neural networks.

SK_DT.ipynb This is a decision tree example (uses sklearn)

SK_BDT.ipynb This is a bosted decision tree example (uses the Adaboost from sklearn)

SK_RF.ipynb This is a random forest example (uses sklearn)

SK_SVM.ipynb This is a support vector machine example (uses the SVM from sklearn, i.e. libsvm)
