## Welcome to my TensorFlow Tutorial Pages

### Overview.

This site have been prepared for undergraduate and graduate tutorials on the use of TensorFlow for a few different types of machine learning algorithm. The tutorial covers:
- Linear Regression
- Multilayer Perceptrons
- Convolutional Neural Networks

with an emphasis on explring the use of these algorithms from a pedagogical perspective.

### Getting started

As the half-life of a given version of code is short, TensorFlow and other Python libraries can change with time. Please do make sure that you check the file **requirements.txt** to ensure that you are trying to use these files with the correct library versions to avoid frustration.

The code can be [downloaded as a zip file](https://github.com/adrianbevan/TensorFlow-Tutorial/archive/main.zip).

If you are using a UNIX/LINUX based system then please make sure that before doing anything else you run the following 
```markdown
  git clone https://github.com/adrianbevan/TensorFlow-Tutorial.git
  cd TensorFlow-Tutorial
  source setup.sh
```
to make directories expected for the output plots and log files.

### Other machine learning tutorials.
